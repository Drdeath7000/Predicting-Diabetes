# Predicting-Diabetes
• Normalized the given data for people who caught diabetes for various reasons by standardization method, that subtracts from each feature its mean and standard deviation
• Created a visualization of the relationship between diabetes progress and a person’s medical situation(blood pressure, etc.) via matplotlib and seaborn
• Predicted the progression of diabetes using a person’s vitals and physical information through implementing 3 linear regression models via sklearn
• Avoided overfitting by implementing L1 regularization (cost function)
